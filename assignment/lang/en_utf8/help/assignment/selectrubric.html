<h1>Rubric</h1>

<p>You may use a rubric to coordinate the grading process of an assignment. The 
   rubric will be visible to the student when viewing the assignment as well as 
   available to your assistants for grading. When a rubric (located between the 
   dashed lines) is selected, the grade dropdown is disabled. This is because 
   the total grade is now based off the rubric's total points. </p>

<p><i>The rubric dropdown may be disabled to begin with</i>. This will occur after an 
   assignment has been created and a grade/feedback has been issued to the 
   submissions of student's work.Therefore, please make any changes required 
   before beginning grading (completing changes before the assignment's 
   available submission date is best).</p>
